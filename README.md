## 👥 Authors
This work was completed as a **group assignment** by:  
- Mikael Alves Brito  
- Georg Matthes
- Viktor Maximilian Lehnhausen

## 📝 Description
The exercise focused on:
- Understanding the connection between **Energy-based Models (EBMs)** and **Diffusion Models (DMs)**  
- Analyzing inference efficiency in diffusion sampling with **Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG)**  
- Learning about **Textual Inversion (TI)** and its role in fine-tuning diffusion models  
- Implementing the loss function, optimizer setup, and main training loop for TI  
- Fine-tuning **Stable Diffusion v1.4** with new placeholder tokens  
- Evaluating the model with diverse prompts and combining multiple learned concepts  

## ⚠️ Note
This project was created as part of a **university exercise sheet** and is **not individual work**.  
All results were prepared collaboratively by Group 11.
